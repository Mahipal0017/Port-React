                            <p>I'm comfortable throughout the stack, but my passion lies in the front end, at the intersection of the web application and the user. I currently build software for the Florida Blue at the Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
                            â€‹Outside of code, I like to create in other ways. From blogging to music-making, photography to guerilla sidewalk chalk street art, I'm always trying new ways of expressing myself. I also like to meditate, talk to strangers, and run lifestyle experiments.
                            Previously, I've taught code to women, served in the Peace Corps, and management consulted for Fortune 100 companies. I also hold a degree in management from the Valparaiso University.
                            <p>Hi there! I am a Fullstack developer specialized in React and Node.js.
                            I've always had a passion for technology and product development - even before becoming a developer, having worn many hats in my career between business development, sales and product management for tech giants and startups in China, Brazil and the US. I use my experience to be more than just a coder, connecting business requirements with modern technology.
                            I have 4+ years of development experience building fullstack products from scratch, developing and integrating APIs, working with a variety of databases and clould platforms and more recently developing mobile applications with React Native.
                            </p>
